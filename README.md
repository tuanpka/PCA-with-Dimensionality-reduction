<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/oF4ydmr.png)  

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a convex optimization problem. The objective function of PCA, which maximizes the variance (the largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix), is convex, along with the constraint that the eigenvectors are unit-normed, resulting in a unit sphere—a convex set. Consequently, this assures that any local solution is also a global optimum, eliminating the presence of local minima. Thus, PCA is an efficient and reliable method for dimensionality reduction, ensuring global optimality in finding principal components.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* Python 3.8 or newer
  ```sh
  [npm install npm@latest -g](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3121/)
  ```
* Google colab: Use this when you just need simple implement 

  ```sh
  https://colab.research.google.com/
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   
   [Click here to take a git clone ](https://github.com/tuanpka/PCA-with-Dimensionality-reduction.git)  

2. Install Python IDE
   ```sh
   https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download
   OR
   https://www.jetbrains.com/dataspell/download
   ```
3. Open .ipynb file with your IDE
4. Change the image location to your path


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Process

* Using Breast Cancer dataset from UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)
* Perform principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensions (30 to 2)
* Making the data easier to visualize and analyze
